# Heart Disease Prediction

This machine learning project predicts whether a person has heart disease based on health-related features such as age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more.

## Dataset
- 1,025 samples
- 14 features (categorical and numerical)
- Target: 0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (best performing model with 88% accuracy)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run this Project
You can run the notebook on **Google Colab** or your local system.

1. Go to the notebook file: [`heart_disease_prediction_full_dataset.ipynb`](https://github.com/raniyashareef/heart-disease-prediction/blob/main/heart_disease_prediction_full_dataset.ipynb)
2. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button (or open it manually in Colab)
3. Run all the cells one by one (Shift + Enter)


## Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`heart_disease_prediction_full_dataset.ipynb`](./heart_disease_prediction_full_dataset.ipynb) | Main Jupyter notebook using the **full heart.csv dataset**, built and tested in Google Colab. |
| [`Heart Disease ML Report.pdf`](./Heart%20Disease%20ML%20Report.pdf) | Academic report submitted for the **Techmaghi “AI with Python” course**, using a **smaller sample** due to compiler limits. |
| [`heart_output.png`](./heart_output.png) | Screenshot showing model output and confusion matrix. |

> **Note:** The PDF report was submitted earlier as part of a course and uses a small sample dataset.  
> The notebook (`.ipynb`) is a newer, improved version using the full dataset and modern tools like Google Colab.
